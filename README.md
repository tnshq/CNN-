Comparative Analysis of pre-trained CNN Models for Transfer Learning for Image Classification of Indian Medicinal Leaves.
use of different pre_trained cnn models to do image classification on same dataset to compare  the performance of different models on a particular machine to be tested.
basically gives out the names of the plants whoose leaves are shown in the dataset .
